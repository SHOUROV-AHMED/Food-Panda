    <h1>Food Service:</h1>
    <h4>The companies that supply foodservice operators are called foodservice distributors. Foodservice distributors sell goods like small wares (kitchen utensils) and foods. Some companies manufacture products in both consumer and foodservice versions. The consumer version usually comes in individual-sized packages with elaborate label design for retail sale. The foodservice version is packaged in a much larger industrial size and often lacks the colorful label designs of the consumer version.</h4>

           <p> Caesar salad isn’t something we eat for its health-consciousness or nutrition-density. Unless, of course, we’re eating this kale Caesar salad recipe, which is Whole30 compliant and full of nutrients.</p>
